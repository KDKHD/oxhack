# TheSumUp
SumUp makes it easy for you to keep your client up to date with the latest information relevant to a specific sale. SumUp replaces the process of you sending a follow-up email with bullet points of relevant articles, with an easy to use and customizable interface. With SumUp you can constantly add new information to the dashboard and your client will immediately get notified about any changes through a text message to their phone.
